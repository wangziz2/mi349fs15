I do not know if my final website is vastly different from
my pre-production because I didn't change the theme and content
but change the design of whole webpage. I think my final design
is better so I did it.

About the preproduction assets, I don't know what should be
included in this final folder because some of homeworks you said
We should put in final folder has already graded in d2l. So
when you check my works if you can not find something please
go to the early folder in my github, thank you!
